# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data (e.g., product reviews, social media posts) to determine whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to classify sentiment automatically.

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world text data
- Converted text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Trained using multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix
- Visualized the results for clear interpretation
